## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. AWS Cognito IDP Integration (`lib-idp-aws-cognito-impl`)

#### Implementation
- ✅ Complete AWS Cognito adapter following hexagonal architecture

  - Session management (list, revoke)
  - Token operations (introspect, getUserInfo)
- ✅ Reactive implementation using Project Reactor (Mono/Flux)
- ✅ SECRET_HASH computation for Cognito client secret
- ✅ Error handling with proper HTTP status codes (404, 401)

#### Testing
- ✅ **10 unit tests** - All passing, using Mockito (no external dependencies)
- ✅ **12 integration tests** - All passing with LocalStack PRO:
  - 3 user management tests
  - 4 authentication tests (including error scenarios)

- ✅ Auto-configuration with conditional bean loading
- ✅ Only one IDP loaded at runtime based on configuration
- ✅ Clear error messages when IDP adapter not found

#### Configuration
- ✅ Complete AWS Cognito configuration in `application.yml`:
  ```yaml
  firefly:
    security-center:
      idp:
        provider: cognito
        cognito:
          region: us-east-1
          user-pool-id: ${COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID}
          client-id: ${COGNITO_CLIENT_ID}
          client-secret: ${COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET}
  ```
- ✅ Environment variable overrides for all settings
- ✅ Both Keycloak and Cognito configurations documented

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Design Patterns Used
1. **Hexagonal Architecture** - Clean separation of ports and adapters
2. **Strategy Pattern** - IDP adapter selection at runtime
3. **Factory Pattern** - Client creation with configurable endpoints/credentials
4. **Repository Pattern** - Session storage abstraction
5. **Builder Pattern** - Clean DTO construction

### Technology Stack
- **Spring Boot 3.x** - Application framework
- **Spring WebFlux** - Reactive web stack
- **Project Reactor** - Reactive programming (Mono/Flux)
- **AWS SDK 2.x** - AWS Cognito integration
- **Keycloak Admin Client** - Keycloak integration
- **Caffeine Cache** - High-performance caching
- **Mockito** - Unit testing
- **Testcontainers** - Integration testing with LocalStack
- **JUnit 5** - Testing framework

---

## 🔧 Technical Challenges Solved

### 1. LocalStack PRO Integration
**Challenge**: LocalStack requires credentials and endpoint configuration for testing  
**Solution**: Enhanced CognitoClientFactory with `setEndpointOverride()` and `setCredentialsProvider()` methods

### 2. Authentication Flow Testing
**Challenge**: Users created with AdminCreateUser have FORCE_CHANGE_PASSWORD status  
**Solution**: Added `AdminSetUserPassword` with `permanent=true` in test setup

### 3. Error Handling in Tests
**Challenge**: Controller handles errors and returns HTTP responses instead of throwing exceptions  
**Solution**: Fixed test expectations to assert HTTP status codes (404, 401) instead of expecting errors

### 4. Multi-IDP Configuration
**Challenge**: Need both Keycloak and Cognito available without conflicts  
**Solution**: Made dependencies optional with conditional bean loading based on configuration
